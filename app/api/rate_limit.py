"""Rate limiting for the public standalone demo's query endpoints.

Scoped narrowly, the same way `app/api/demo_guard.py` is: one dependency,
added only to `POST /query` and `POST /ui/query` — the two routes that run
real retrieval/reranking/generation work per call and are the ones a
scripted loop against a public, credential-free demo would actually target.
Every other route (`/health`, `/ready`, document reads, the rest of the UI)
is untouched.

**In-process, not Redis, not a database table.** The standalone demo's own
deployment (`docker-compose.demo.yml`) is one `app` container against one
database — there is no second process or replica this state would need to
be shared with, so an in-memory store is sufficient and avoids adding an
external service to satisfy a portfolio demo's abuse protection. It is also
why this limiter is deliberately unsuitable, as written, for a
multi-replica deployment: each replica would keep its own independent
counts, which is a documented limitation, not an oversight (see the
project's own rate-limiting inspection notes).

**Off unless explicitly enabled.** `Settings.demo_rate_limit_enabled`
defaults to `False`, so Live Mode and any deployment that never sets
`KNOWLEDGEOS_DEMO_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` is completely unaffected — the
dependency below returns immediately without touching the request, the
clock, or the limiter's internal state.

**Two injectable seams, both using this project's own existing
dependency-override pattern** (the same one `demo.app.create_demo_app()`
already uses for `embedding_provider`/`rerank_provider`/`llm_provider`),
so a test can control both without a real sleep and without needing
`TestClient` to fake a distinct peer IP per call:

- `client_identity` — a FastAPI dependency, overridable via
  `app.dependency_overrides[client_identity] = lambda: "some-id"`.
- `get_rate_limiter` — a FastAPI dependency resolving the one
  `InMemoryRateLimiter` this process uses; a test overrides it with a
  fresh instance built on its own injected clock function.

**Not `X-Forwarded-For`.** No hosting target is chosen yet, and trusting a
client-supplied header with no configured, known proxy in front of this
process would let a visitor set their own header and evade the limit
entirely. `client_identity` reads the direct ASGI peer address
(`Request.client.host`) until a specific, trusted proxy mechanism is
deliberately added later.
